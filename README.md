## A multi-container application for technology related subreddit comment analytics

* Designed a microservice architecture to perform real-time analytics on comments from technology-related subreddits
(e.g., r/technology), with a cumulative analysis of over `220k` comments from `76k` users.
* Utilized `Kafka` as the data broker to decouple the comment ingestion and keyword extraction using named entity
recognition enabled by `Spacy`.
* Streamed data from Kafka to `Elasticsearch` using `Kafka Connect Elasticsearch Sink` and `ksqlDB`, and built
a `Kibana` dashboard to identify the active Redditors and hot topics within user-specified time range.
* Orchestrated the multi-container (10 containers) application with `docker-compose`.
